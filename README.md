# hello-world
Here I go.

In the process of teaching myself to code. I've had very minimal exposure to coding: highschool (HTML), College (Basic C) and a little bit after college taking various free online inroduction courses (HTML, PHP, C, Python). My background is working as a field engineer in oil and gas and a short stint (1 year) as a mfg programmer (Allen Bradley software/hardware).
