# hello-world
Here I go.

In the process of teaching myself to code. I've had very minimal exposure to coding in highschool (HTML), College (C) and various online inroduction courses (HTML, PHP, C, Python). My background is working as a field engineer in oil and gas and a short stint as a mfg programmer.
